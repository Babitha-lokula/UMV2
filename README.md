# UMV2 Model
Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that categorizes each pixel in an image into a class or object. Although a number of relevant architectures have been proposed in recent years, they incur the problems like computational cost,large amounts of training data, class imbalance, edge uncertainty, varying sizes of objects, shadow and lighting variations. Such a more number of drawbacks degrades the semantic segmentation performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and generalization capability.  This paper presents UMV2, an efficient deep learning model specifically designed for semantic segmentation of satellite imagery. The proposed model integrates the hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of the Unet++ architecture with the lightweight MobileNetV2 encoder, resulting in a balanced approach that enhances segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments on a diverse satellite image dataset, UMV2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an accuracy of 0.8917, Mean IoU of 0.5212, precision of 0.8912, recall of 0.8919, and F1-score of 0.8913. These results demonstrate UMV2's effectiveness in accurately segmenting complex satellite images, making it a promising solution for real-world applications such as land cover classification, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.
